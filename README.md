# WorkTime
PRIVACY -> All your data tracks in \DB\ folder, remove it if you needed
-!!! Does not hide your data, do not use it in public locations, or add data hiding/crypto.

1. Must be started with admin rights, win32 DOES NOT WORKS in amd64 platfroms, Use win64 in AMD64 platforms.
2. Admins manifest already applyed for project, for DEBUG -> starts delphi with admins rights.
3. Automatically restarts when new day reached, have Mutex for preventing starts of 2 more instances.
4. Filters in \WCards\X-Category\ExeName.txt, where:
X - is an integer for sorting categories, 
ExeName - is 'exe name' for filter, .txt - is editable by notepad

ExeName.txt is multyline filter file, where each line is:
'\*' + 'LINE TEXT FROM FILE' + '\*', for filtering forms feaders. '\*' as first and last character will add automaticaly.
an empty file meaning just '\*' filter
New lines can be added by double clicking an line in ListView.


How it works : 
Every 1000ms -> Track 'active form header' and it '.exe' -> filter this data by \WCards\X-Category\ExeName.txt -> Add into filtered 'Category'
Saves data every 10s or OnApplicationExit only for changed processes.
Re-Filters TODAY data only OnApplicationRestart
